AVR ATmega32 Assembly Projects Collection Using only Assembly.

It serves as a library of fundamental drivers and logical routines for the ATmega32 microcontroller.
It includes examples for handling Timers, Serial Communication, and arithmetic operations.

The project implements:

1. Hexadecimal to Decimal conversion routine (splitting units, tens, and hundreds)
2. Sensor data threshold logic for value comparison and sorting
3. Timer0 configuration in Normal and CTC modes for hardware delays
4. Square wave generation using Output Compare Match
5. Pulse Event Counter to count external signals on the T0 pin
6. Software UART (Bit-Banging) drivers for data transmission and reception
7. Software delay routines using nested loops
8. Switch status checking and conditional Port output control
